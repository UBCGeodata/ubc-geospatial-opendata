GitHub
------
* GitHub is used most often to host code for version control and collaboration. 
* It is also an easy way to make geospatial data browsable, viewable and downloadable.
* Information about using GitHub: [here](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/)

### Viewing data in the repositories
* GitHub uses [Leaflet](http://leafletjs.com/) to display any geojson file.
* You can click on any .geojson file and it will display as a map, allowing you to click on features.
* For example: [UBC Vancouver Buildings](https://github.com/UBCGeodata/ubc-geospatial-opendata/blob/master/ubcv/locations/geojson/ubcv_buildings_simple.geojson)
* CSV files can also be previewed within github: [UBC Vancouver Mailing Addresses](https://github.com/UBCGeodata/ubc-geospatial-opendata/blob/master/ubcv/locations/csv/ubcv_address_mailing.csv)

### Downloading data
* You can get the whole repository of data by clicking on the green 'Clone or download' button on the right of page.

For only a single type of data: 
* Navigate to the location of the data you are interested in.
*  For example  ubc-geospatial-opendata > ubcv > locations > csv > ubcv_address_mailing.csv 
* For a text file (like .geojson or .csv), you can right-click on the 'download' or 'raw' button and choose 'save link as'.
